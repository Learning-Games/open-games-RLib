# Learning Framework

* This repo is an extension of the basic [open games engine](https://github.com/philipp-zahn/open-games-hs). It provides an experimental playground for interacting learning games through an interface to [Ray RLib](https://docs.ray.io/en/latest/rllib/index.html).

If you have questions, drop me (Philipp) a [mail](mailto:philipp.m.zahn@gmail.com)!

This repo is work in progress. Expect changes at any time!
